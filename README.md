  <dt>Prelude</dt>
  <dd>Prelude is a compiler toolchain for generating
        intermediate machine code with integrated 
        features such as memory management, 
        garbage collector (hopefully) and cross platform integration.</dd>

The Prelude toolchain consists of:

* Prelude C (this): Compiler for Prelude

    * libprc: Standard library for Prelude C

* Prelude MM: Memory management utility

    * Prelude GC (Experimental): Garbage collector
